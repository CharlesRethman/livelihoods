  "description" : "The zone is located in the low-lying Zambezi Plains covering the districts of Senanga, Mongu, Kalabo, Lukulu, the western part of Zambezi, and Chavuma in the western part of the country. The average rainfall is between 800 and 1000 mm, and the average temperature varies between 10 degrees Celsius in July to 34 degrees Celsius in October. Miombo woodland and grassland predominates the vegetation in the zone with moderately fertile soils. The major natural resources include wildlife (game), thatching grass (mwange), and timber. The Zambezi River, offering opportunities for fishing and water transport, bisects the area.
The dominant ethnic groups include Kwangwa, Nyengo, Mwenyi, Mbunda, Lwalange, Lozi, Luvale, Nkoya, Chokwe, Lunda, Shanjo Mashi, Mulonga, Mbukushu, and Fwe. The population density is low at about 10 inhabitants per square kilometer.
Rainfed agricultural and wetland farming is the predominant livelihood. Landholdings and cattle ownership (with associated plows) for draft power and for sale are the major determinants of wealth in this zone.
The average landholding is about 1-2 ha per household for food crop production. The poor cultivate by hand, while the better-off use animal tillage. The main, rainfed growing season is 110-150 days from November to March. The zone is a surplus rice- producing area, but people also grow maize, cassava, and millet for household consumption. Poor households mitigate low maize yields by producing two crops of maize per year, a rainfed crop and another season using flood recession and wetland moisture. The rivers are fished using nets and lines.
All households keep a few livestock, but the high cost of purchasing and maintaining cattle and oxen makes them unsuitable for poor households. Instead, poor households raise goats and pigs. Livestock are mainly sold for cash; slaughtering is usually reserved for festivals and important functions such as funerals and weddings. Local chickens and pigs are secondary sources of food and income throughout the zone.
The better-off earn their income through the following: the sale of rice during the entire year, the sale of cattle and hiring of tillage services, and trade and transportation. Sources of income for the poor are primarily seasonal, forcing them to diversify their income base. The main income sources for the poor include the sale of own-produced rice, agricultural labor, beer brewing, fishing, and the sale of charcoal. The poor spend most of their cash on maize meal and school fees, particularly for primary education.
Own-produced rice is available for consumption throughout the year, even for the poor, while maize stocks typically last only for four months after harvest in April and May for the poor. Cassava is generally available throughout the year with fresh cassava mostly accessed from May to October and dry cassava November to April. Access to agricultural labor opportunities, the main source of income for the poor, is available when agricultural activities intensify, during the January to February, the May to July, and the October to December periods.
Access to local markets is generally fair with most areas having access roads to the main, district service centers where traders and the FRA purchase rice and maize. During rainy season, access to markets is poor, particularly for areas west of the Zambezi. Movement of goods and people are limited during river flooding. Rice and cattle transactions dominate trading in the zones. Zambeef, a major cattle and meat company, and the Food Reserve Agency (FRA) are the main market stakeholders. The largest markets for beef and rice produced in this zone are in urban areas, particularly Lusaka and Copperbelt Province.
The most common hazards are flooding and livestock diseases, which occur once in three years, and prolonged dry spells, which occur at least once in five years. To mitigate the impact of negative production shocks, poor households tend to increase off-season cultivation of maize, particularly for households located close to the flood plain, and to increase the search for casual labor to improve access to food and cash income.

  "description" : "The zone is located in Shangâ€™ombo, Sesheke, and parts of Kazungula and Senanga Districts within the low-lying grassland and wetland across the Zambezi River in Western Province. The zone falls within agro-ecological Region I, with an annual average rainfall of <800 mm falling between November and March. The alluvial soils are fertile with aerosols, greysols, and planosols, especially along the Zambezi river basin. The climate is generally semiarid: hot and dry from August to October and cool and dry from April to July. These conditions support forests with Baikeae and Miombo woodlands important for supporting timber production and a number of species of wild animals. The environment provides a wide range of opportunities for local crafts, lumber, and tourism.
The inhabitants are mainly Mbunda, Shanjo, Mashi, Mulonga, Mbukushu Fwe, Lozi, Totela, Subiya, Toka, Nkoya, and Chokwe ethnic groups. The population density is moderate with about 10 inhabitants per square kilometer. The main economic activities include crop and livestock production, formal employment related to timber and tourism, timber, handicrafts related to tourism, fishing, and the sale of wild fruits.
The main rainfed growing season is short (from 90-120 days); during which most households grow pearl millet, sorghum, maize, and some cassava. Households with access to lowlands or wetlands around the Zambezi produce off-season maize and vegetables using mostly residual moisture. The average arable landholding is estimated at 1 ha per household lower than the national average of 1.5 ha. The amount of land cultivated, the number and type of livestock owned, and the range of productive assets determine differences in wealth in this livelihood zone. Better- off households with animal traction and ploughs are able to cultivate more land compared to poor households who rely mostly on hand hoes. This enables better-off households to generate more income and food compared to the poor households.
The better-off households own cattle for sale and to provide milk, manure, and draft power. The cattle are kept in communal grazing areas. Households slaughter cattle for meat during special occasions, such as weddings and funerals. Fishing thrives, especially along the Zambezi River and its tributaries and lagoons. The fishermen from poor households use gill nets, baskets, spears, and dugout canoes for fishing.
The poor obtain their food from own production supplemented by market purchases and payment in kind for labor, whereas the better-off produce most of their food. The income sources for the poor are mainly labor in timber production and casual agricultural or construction labor/thatching, sale of small livestock, and brewing. The poor may sell crops in good years. The better-off on the other hand earn their income through the sale of surplus crops, sale of livestock, fishing, hiring out equipment such as carts and ploughs, and milk sales.
Access to major markets is generally satisfactory owing to the good road infrastructure network, with the exception of feeder roads linking main roads and interior areas located further from main roads making market access difficult. The zone sells timber produced to urban areas outside the zone. The zone transports the timber to Livingstone and Lusaka by rail. The main handicraft market is in the Kazungula tourist area.
Common hazards include flooding and livestock disease outbreaks, which occur once in three years. Drought or prolonged dry spells occur once every five years, lowering crop yields. In response, poor households increase the search for casual labor opportunities either locally or in towns or the nearby Commercial Rail Line Maize, Livestock, and Cotton Zone.

  "description" : "The zone is located in the highland area of Kaoma, Zambezi, Mwinilunga, Ikelenge, and parts of Lukulu, Kabombo, and Mufumbwe Districts. It lies across agro-ecological Region II and III, receiving annual rainfall between 800 to 1,200 mm between October and April. Temperatures range from an average minimum of 6 degrees Celsius in July associated with some frost to an average maximum of 33 degrees Celsius in October. The soil is sandy in the South, the central (Luampa), and the northwestern areas, verging on sandy loams in the northeast and northern areas. Soils are moderately fertile, favoring agriculture. Local natural resources include timber, game, grassy wetlands (dambos), and thatching grass (mwange). Woodlands dominate the area with grasslands in the northwest.
The dominant ethnic groups are Lozi, Lunda, Luchazi, Luvale, Chokwe, Nkoya, and Mbundus. The moderately populated zone has a population density of about eight inhabitants per square kilometer. Landholding for cultivation is relatively low due to presence of forest and game management areas, with an average of one ha per household, used primarily for food crop production.
Cassava, maize, and cattle are the major sources of food and income in the zone. The major production system is rainfed agriculture, with a long growing season of 140-160 days. The long growing season and sandy soils are particularly good for cassava production. The zone is a cassava-surplus and maize-deficit area. Other common crops include beans, cowpeas, groundnuts, rice, sweet potatoes, and pineapples. The cattle in the zone provide both cash through sale and provide manure, draft power, and milk for consumption.
Access to draft power is the main determinant of wealth in this zone. With draft power, better-off households can own and cultivate larger land areas than are accessible to the poor households. The production of draft power also provides benefits of livestock sales, milk sales, and access to manure for fertilization. Better-off households are, therefore, self-sufficient in staple food production. Poor households, however, cultivate using manual labor and retained seed. As they cannot afford cattle, they raise
poultry, goats, and pigs. As a result of these constraints, poor households cannot meet their food needs through own production; they also purchase food on markets and receive food as in-kind payments for laboring on behalf of the better- off. The poor wealth group relies on several, relatively smaller income-earning sources, while better-off rely on a few, high- yielding income-earning sources, including the crop sales, timber, and livestock.
Physical access to major markets is fair to poor mainly because of poor road and communication infrastructure. Cassava, maize, livestock, and timber are the major commodities traded in the zone, destined primarily for urban service centers in the districts under this zone. Poor households buy maize grain from FRA and private traders when stock has run out. Consumers and retailers buy and sell cassava roots and cassava chips both in local markets and outside the zone, especially in Lusaka. Farmers and traders sell cattle through local butcheries and main abattoirs. Households buy and sell maize and cassava on local markets. Timber is transported to Lusaka and sold to private buyers.
Prolonged dry spells and/or droughts are a major hazard in the zone, leading to below-average maize yields. In these bad years, poor households respond by increasing local and migrant casual labor, charcoal sales, and small livestock sales to earn additional income to purchase more food, often at above-average prices. Increased charcoal production may cause environmental damage in the long run.

  "description" : "The smallholder farms of Kaoma and Mufumbwe Districts dominate the lowland and plateau grassy wetlands (dambos) and some mountainous areas. The soils are generally fertile, sandy and loamy. The zone lies within agro-ecological Region II with an average rainfall of 800 to 1000 mm, falling between November and April. The long growing period of 120-160 days makes the area suitable for long-cycle maize production. Local temperatures range from an average minimum of 6 degrees Celsius in July to an average maximum of 33 degrees Celsius in October. The vegetation, characterized by Miombo woodlands, has sparse grasslands. Natural resources include game, thatching grass, forests, and dambos.
The main ethnic groups found in the zone include Lozi, Nkoya, Luvale, Mbunda, Luchazi, Chokwe, and Kaonde tribes. The population density is moderate, with an average of 8 inhabitants per square kilometer. Landholding averages 2.5 ha per household used for the cultivation of multiple staple foods, as well as cash crops.
Hired labor and oxen are key to cultivation in this zone. The Nkeyema and Kalumwange parts of the zone use primarily animal tillage and tractors. Crop production is mainly rainfed, with some irrigated and wetland farming in isolated parts of the zone. The zone is a surplus-growing area for maize, tobacco, and sweet potato, although other crops including cassava, groundnut, cowpea, sorghum and millet are grown, usually with manual labor for household consumption. The bulk of the tobacco is grown on an out-grower scheme basis. The Dwarf Cavendish banana is commonly grown in the central and southern part of zone, in the Litoya area.
The main productive asset is land for both the poor and the better- off, followed by tractors/light trucks and cattle for the better-off, and bicycles and hand tools for the poor. Given that the poor cannot access animal traction or mechanization to cultivate larger land areas, they rely on markets for food part of the year. They rely on labor and self-employment (beer brewing, harvesting thatching grass, and selling charcoal) for income. The better-off are self-
sufficient in staple food and earn income through selling of tobacco, surplus maize, petty trade, and transportation.
Road conditions are generally poor in the zone, posing a challenge for smaller-scale traders, particularly over long distances. Maize trade is highest from June to September when the Food Reserve Agency (FRA), the largest buyer of maize in the country, buys maize at designated satellite depots. Private retailers also buy maize at local markets within the zone to supply neighboring zones. For tobacco, the same companies that sponsor tobacco production buy the harvest between March and June and export to foreign countries from Lusaka markets. Other locally-traded commodities of significance in the zone are sweet potato and groundnuts. This zone is a net importer of labor, particularly from Western and Northwestern Cassava, Maize and Cattle Zone, with most people coming to work on tobacco fields.
Livestock disease outbreaks are the major hazard in the zone, caused by its proximity to Kafue national park. In response to poor agricultural production, poor households increase casual work activities locally and migrate to nearby urban areas like Kaoma to seek work.

  "description" : "The zone lies on a plateau with an altitude ranging from 1000-1500 meters above sea level in Mufumbwe, Kabompo, and parts of Mwinilunga Districts, bordering Angola to the west. The zone lies in agro-ecological Region III, characterized by moderately fertile, sandy and loamy soils. Rainfall is relatively high, ranging between 1000 to 1500 mm per annum falling between November and April. Climatic conditions are typical of the savannah with minimum temperatures of 10-20 degrees Celsius during the dry months of May-July. The hot, dry season has maximum temperatures of 20-32 degrees Celsius. Covered by dense forest and savannah grasslands, the zone is suitable for hardwood timber production and rangelands.
This sparsely-populated zone has a population density of about 4 inhabitants per square kilometer and average cultivated land area of 1-1.5 hectares per household. The main ethnic groups include Lozi, Nkoya, Luvale, Mbunda, Luchazi, Chokwe, and Toka tribes.
Forest products are important sources of food and income, particularly game, timber, charcoal, and honey. Mineral resources in the zone include copper, quartz, tourmaline, and amethyst, with new mines expected to open in the coming years.
The climatic conditions in the zone are suitable for the production of cassava, maize, groundnuts, and beans. The zone has a long growing period of 140-160 days that enables growing of long-cycle crop varieties. Better-off households in the zone keep some cattle, while poor households keep some small livestock.
The size of land a household is able to cultivate, the ownership of livestock, and productive assets are key wealth determinants in the zone and effectively influence food and income strategy options. Poor households use family or hired labor for manual cultivation as they lack access to draft power or funds to hire enough labor. They are unable to produce enough maize to be self-sufficient, so they
also purchase maize, particularly between November and March. The better-off are able to obtain their staple foods entirely from own production throughout the year. Both the poor and better-off derive much of their income from timber production, honey production, and crop sales. Additional income sources for the poor include on-farm casual labor, while the better-off earn most income from livestock sales and equipment rental, particularly carts for transportation.
Market access is relatively poor in the zone as most of the markets are located outside the zone with long distances and poorly developed road networks. Households unable to buy or sell in markets outside the zone face higher prices on local markets dominated by private traders. Most agricultural goods from this zone flow either within the zone or to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Traders market timber and honey, however, toward Solwezi District and Copperbelt and Lusaka Provinces.
Poor households have been able to cope relatively well with shocks in the past through intensifying wild food consumption and sale, migrating in search of labor income, and selling livestock. However, as the frequency of shocks increases and livestock ownership declines, the ability of households to mitigate food security risks without external support may also decline. The demand for unskilled labor during the cropping season is high, providing good opportunities for poor households to earn income.

  "description" : "The zone covers communal areas in and around new copper mining areas of Solwezi and Kasempa Districts in the Northwestern Province bordering DRC in the north. The land is flat to gently undulating slopes with an altitude of 900-1500 meters above sea level. The zone falls within agro-ecological Region III. The zone receives 1000-1500 mm of rainfall per annum between November and April. Maximum temperatures peak at 32 degrees Celsius between September and December. During the winter months of May-July, average minimum temperatures fall between 16 and 18 degrees Celsius with a slight risk of frost, especially in wetland/dambo areas and particularly damaging to horticulture crops. The well-drained soils consist of deep, strong red, acidic, clayey and coarse, sandy soils. In some parts of the zone, shallow, moderately-to-imperfectly-drained and loamy soils exist. Vegetation is mainly composed of Miombo woodlands and open savannah grasslands. Exploitation of copper, iron, zinc, and nickel began in recent years. The Kafue and Lunga game reserve and management areas provide hunting opportunities.
Kasempa is sparsely populated with about three people per square kilometer; Solwezi has about 8 people per square kilometer. The average land cultivated in the zone ranges from 1 to 1.5 hectares per household. The Kaonde are the main ethnic group in the zone.
Mining activities that are increasingly gaining prominence provide an important source of employment and market for local agricultural produce. Trade in agricultural produce and other basic non-food items is an important additional livelihood activity in the zone.
